\section{Definition of goals}
	\subsection{Must-have}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The program can be integrated to scientific code which provides the given code interface.
			\item The program must be able to receive different task-structures.
			\item The program must be able to execute and call scientific code.
			\item Must provide different scheduling strategies.
			\item Must provide a strategy interface.
			\item Must be able to dynamically chose between provided strategies.
			\item Must be able to keep track of each task.
			\item Must perform data mining on collected statistics.
			\item Collected data must be visualised.
			\item Estimate runtime each task will have.
			\item Must collect statistic data for each task.
			\item Must store the result of the calculation for each task.
			\item It must be possible to use variable numbers of parameters for statistics.
			\item Must callable from the command line.
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Nice-to-have}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Provide a GUI to configure the program.
			\item Several scheduler instances should be able to communicate.
			\item Scheduler should be able to dynamically change it's MPI-world.
			\item Scheduler provides a task stealing algorithm in order to reduce the amount of process migration between processors.
