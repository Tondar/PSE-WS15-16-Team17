		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Database}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Initialize database
			%\item Files will be placed after computation as usable files for plotting.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\subsubsection{Data mining}
	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Read data from database module %TODO database????
				\item Write data into database module%TODO database????
				\item Process task queries from scheduler
				\item Calculate weight estimation 
				\item Create statistics from task computation
			\end{itemize}
	
		%\subsubsection{Queue database} %into scheduler
	
		%	\begin{itemize}
		%		\item Read-functions for the queue file.
		%		\item Write-functions for the queue file.
		%	\end{itemize}
		
		
		\subsubsection{Bookkeeping database}
	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Bookkeeping should be conducted for the following events:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Task appears
					\item Task started
					\item Task finished 
					\item Interconnection between processes
				\end{enumerate}
			\end{itemize}
	
		\subsubsection{Statistics database}
	
			%TODO WARNING
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Read/Write functions for the data mining module for the statistic file.
				\item Search for similar and equal data in statistics
				\item Duplication of files on too high amount of requests.
				\item Delete duplicated files after finishing the scientific simulation
				\item Collect information about the runtime of the task depending on task parameters.
			\end{itemize}
	
	
	\subsubsection{Interface}
		\begin{itemize}
		
			\item The program must provide the place\_task interface
			\item Receive different task types from the scientific code
		\end{itemize}
		
		
	\subsubsection{Visualization}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Export bookkeeping to .vtk format
			\item Export statistics to .vtk format
			%TODO interconnection graph for master-slave / taskstealing
		\end{itemize}
		
	\subsection{Functions required for optional features}
