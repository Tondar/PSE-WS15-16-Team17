\section{Global test cases}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item MOAB input is starting the scheduler
			\item successfully MPI World initialization (F100)
			
			\item receive a task (F310)
			\item Master Scheduler is creating Dummy-workers(fußnote erklärung:)
			\item bind dummy code on scheduler (F130, F140)
			
			for both designs all test all strategy
			1.
			\item select Master-Worker design (F70, F80)
			\item select scheduling strategy in user interface (F70, F80)
			\item place tasks on workers (F190)
			\item execute each strategy through execution interface Master/Worker (F30, F40, F50, F60, 							F70, F110, F120)
			2.
			\item select Multiple-queue parallel scheduling design (F70, F80)
			\item select scheduling strategy in user interface (F70, F80)
			\item place tasks on workers (F190)
			\item execute each strategy through execution interface, Master/Worker(F30, F40, F50, F60, 							F70, F110, F120)
			
			
			\item Initialize database (F200)
			\item write a task entry in statistic file (F210, F220, F270)
			\item read a task entry in statistic file (F210, F220, F270)
			\item calculate a weight for one task (F240)
			\item use the search function on this one task in statistic (F280)
			\item duplicate one statistic file (F290)
			\item delete the (duplicated) file (F260)
			\item write a task entry in bookkeeping file
			\item export a .vtk file (F320, F330)
